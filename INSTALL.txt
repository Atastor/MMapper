                 INSTALLING MMapper Version 2.0

1.  You can get latest version of MMapper on http://sourceforge.net/projects/mmapper web page.
  
2.  Uncompress the archive you downloaded into any directory,
    e.g. C:\mmapper\ or ~/mmapper

3.  Building
    You need Qt >= 4.1 to be installed along with CMake >= 2.6. If you would
    prefer to not use CMake then you can read the old instructions at the end
    of this guide.
    To create makefiles for your machine type and OS using CMake:

        C:
        cd \mmapper
        winbuild.bat
        
        or 
        
        cd ~\mmapper
        ./build.sh

4.  That's all. MMapper is now installed.
    
5.  Set up your client according to the wiki instructions at:
    http://mume.org/wiki/index.php/Guide_to_install_mmapper2_on_Windows

We hope you will enjoy using MMapper. Good luck!
